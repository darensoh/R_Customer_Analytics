# Customer Analytics 

# RFM, K-Means, and Hierarchical Clustering Analysis

## Introduction
This project involves analyzing gym usage data on a university campus using various data analysis and machine learning techniques. We employ Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis, K-Means clustering, and Hierarchical clustering to segment and profile gym visitors.

## Background

- **Libraries**:
  - `readxl`: For reading Excel files.
  - `lubridate`: For date manipulation.
  - `tidyverse`: For data manipulation and visualization.
  - `ggplot2`: For data visualization.
  - `treemapify`: For creating treemaps.
  - `rfm`: For RFM analysis.

## Analysis

### 1. Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) Model
**Objective**: To review the gym usage on campus.

**Questions**:
1. What are the average frequency and duration of gym visits across gym visitors?
2. How can the RFM model help segment and profile our gym visitors?
3. How has the profile of gym users changed over time?
4. Explore other attributes associated with different gym visitor segments.

#### Load the Required Libraries
```
pacman::p_load(readxl, lubridate, tidyverse, ggplot2, treemapify, rfm, caret, cluster, factoextra, plotly)
```
#### Load and Inspect the Data
```
df <- read_excel("..gym_staff.xlsx")  - Copy file path to link the excel file
str(df)
summary(df)
df <- df %>% mutate_if(is.character, as.factor) 
df$Date <- ymd(df$Date)
```
#### Data Cleaning
```
sum(is.na(df))
df[rowSums(is.na(df)) > 0, ] 
sum(duplicated(df))
```
### 2. Latency Analysis
**Objective:** To determine the typical time span between gym visits.

#### Number of Visits per Customer
```
df_visits <- df %>% 
  group_by(ID) %>%
  mutate(Visit = n()) %>%
  distinct(ID, .keep_all = TRUE)
summary(df_visits$Visit)
summary(df_visits)
```
#### Days Between Visits
```
df_days <- df %>%
  group_by(ID) %>%
  mutate(Date_Diff = as.numeric(difftime(Date, lag(Date), units = "days"))) %>%
  mutate(counter = seq_along(ID)) %>%
  arrange(ID)
view(df_days)
df_days <- df_days %>% select(ID, counter, Date_Diff)
```
#### Average Number of Days Between Visits
```
latency <- pivot_wider(df_days, names_from = counter, values_from = Date_Diff)
latency <- as.data.frame(latency)
rownames(latency) <- latency[,"ID"] 
latency$`ID` <- NULL
latency$`1` <- NULL
lmean <- round(colMeans(latency, na.rm = TRUE), digit = 2)
lmedian <- apply(latency, 2, median, na.rm = TRUE)
lcount <- apply(latency, 2, function(x) sum(!is.na(x)))
lsummary <- rbind(lcount, lmean, lmedian)
rownames(lsummary) <- c("Count", "Mean", "Median")
```
### 3. Duration of Each Visit
**Objective:** To calculate the duration of each gym visit.
```
df$duration <- difftime(df$Checkout, df$Checkin, units = "mins")
df$duration <- round(as.numeric(df$duration), 2)
summary(df$duration)
hist(df$duration)
```

### 4. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis
**Objective:** To compare revenue generated from single entries versus memberships.

#### Revenue Calculation
```
summary(as.factor(df_visits$Passtype))
df_visits$Membership <- ifelse(grepl("Fitness Gym Membership", df_visits$Passtype) == TRUE, 100, 0) 
df_visits$Single <- ifelse(grepl("Per-Entry Ticket", df_visits$Passtype) == TRUE, df_visits$Visit * 4.50, 0)
Revenue_membership <- sum(df_visits$Membership)
Revenue_single <- sum(df_visits$Single)
Total_revenue <- Revenue_membership + Revenue_single
df_visits$year5 <- ifelse(df_visits$Membership == 100, df_visits$Membership * 5, df_visits$Single * 5)
hist(df_visits$year5)
```

#### Identify Potential Members
```
Potential_member <- df_visits %>% filter(Single > 100)
View(Potential_member)
Potential_member$Savings <- Potential_member$Single - 100
```
### 5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
**Objective:** To visually explore the dataset and identify patterns.

#### Data Visualization
```
ggplot(df) + geom_bar(aes(y = Passtype)) 
ggplot(df) + geom_boxplot(aes(x = Gender, y = duration)) 
ggplot(df) + geom_bar(aes(y = Age, fill = Passtype), position = "fill") 
ggplot(df) + geom_bar(aes(y = Gender, fill = Passtype), position = "fill") 
ggplot(df, aes(y = ULU, fill = Passtype)) + geom_bar(aes(y = ULU, fill = Passtype)) 
```

### 6. K-Means Clustering
**Objective:** To cluster gym visitors based on their visit frequency, recency, and duration.

#### Data Preprocessing
```
preProcValues <- preProcess(u_df[,c("recency_days", "transaction_count","avg_duration")], method = c("center", "scale"))
u_df_std <- predict(preProcValues, u_df[,c("recency_days", "transaction_count","avg_duration")])
```
#### Determine Optimal Number of Clusters
```
fviz_nbclust(u_df_std[,c("recency_days", "transaction_count","avg_duration")], kmeans, method = "wss")
fviz_nbclust(u_df_std[,c("recency_days", "transaction_count","avg_duration")], kmeans, method = "silhouette") 
```
#### K-Means Clustering with k = 4
```
set.seed(10)
kmeans_4 <- kmeans(u_df_std, 4)
u_df <- u_df %>% mutate(kcluster4 = kmeans_4$cluster)
plot_ly(u_df, x = ~transaction_count, y = ~recency_days, z = ~avg_duration, type = "scatter3d", mode = "markers", color = ~kcluster4)
fviz_cluster(kmeans_4, u_df_std[,c("recency_days", "transaction_count","avg_duration")], ellipse.type = "norm")
sil <- silhouette(kmeans_4$cluster, dist(u_df_std[,c("recency_days", "transaction_count","avg_duration")]))
fviz_silhouette(sil)
```
### 7. Hierarchical Clustering
**Objective:** To perform hierarchical clustering and compare with K-Means clustering results.

#### Hierarchical Clustering with k = 4
```
hc_dist <- dist(u_df_std, method = "euclidean")
hc_cluster <- hclust(d = hc_dist, method = "average")
plot(hc_cluster)
rect.hclust(hc_cluster, k = 4, border = 1:9)
```
#### Hierarchical Clustering with Sample Data
```
set.seed(44)
u_df1 <- u_df[sample(nrow(u_df), 40),]
preProcValues <- preProcess(u_df1[,c("recency_days", "transaction_count","avg_duration")], method = c("center", "scale"))
u_df1_std <- predict(preProcValues, u_df1[,c("recency_days", "transaction_count","avg_duration")])
u_df1_dist <- dist(u_df1_std, method = "euclidean")
u_df1_hc <- hclust(d = u_df1_dist, method = "average")
u_df1$hcluster4 <- cutree(tree = u_df1_hc, k = 4)
plot(u_df1_hc)
rect.hclust(u_df1_hc, k = 4, border = 2:5)
```

## What I Learnt
The importance of RFM analysis in understanding customer segments.
How clustering techniques like K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering can help in customer segmentation.
The role of data visualization in interpreting and presenting data analysis results.

## Insights
Memberships provide a stable income compared to single entries.
There are specific customer segments, such as potential members, that could be targeted for membership promotions.
Regular data analysis can reveal changes in customer behavior over time, helping businesses to adapt their strategies accordingly.

## Conclusions
This project demonstrates the power of data analysis in understanding customer behavior and improving business decisions. By using RFM analysis, K-Means clustering, and Hierarchical Clustering, we can segment customers effectively and identify key insights to drive business growth.

## Closing Thoughts
Data-driven decision-making is essential in todayâ€™s competitive environment. This project shows how R can be used to analyze customer data and derive actionable insights. Whether you are looking to improve customer retention or optimize revenue streams, understanding your data is the first step towards success.
